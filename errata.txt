put silkscreen 5V+ 5V-
footprint for astart not 100% correct with positions of the pins in the top row
tracks for phases to J5 are missing on bottom layer
lm317 dorpout of 3V recommended. Idea was to use 4.3V for motor -> dropout only 0.7
also the voltage divider on lm317 has wrong values (vref = 1.25V, vref between output and adjust)
